This PHP Laravel application was developed to help a fast-food store manage its inventory efficiently. The app presents products on a sleek, restaurant-style dashboard, allowing service staff to easily verify orders before delivering them to customers. It also calculates reorder points based on historical product turnover, helping ensure stock levels are maintained.

The admin dashboard provides the business administrator with actionable insights, enabling them to place orders with suppliers based on these reorder point estimates, streamlining inventory management and reducing the risk of stockouts.
